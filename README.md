`morskey` is a recreational app that captures the user's keyboard and translates
straight-key morse code input on a key of the user's choosing to inputs for
other applications like Discord, a browser, or even games.

## User Guide

the instructions in the **Developer Guide** section.

Read docs/user-manual.md for a clear specification of the apps features.

This sounds like a mild violation of The Mythical Man Month but I will gladly be
proven wrong here. Deadline is not absolute, since I am learning, but I think
it's reasonable and I will try my best to stick to it, even if I have to cut
corners to stick to it, to maintain my learning integrity.
