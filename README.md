# morskey
`morskey` is an recreational application intended to allow the user to make \
straight-key morse code inputs with their keyboard, which are then translated \
into character outputs for applications, like a browser, Discord or other chat \
clients, and even games if you're interested in that!

This project is done for fun by it's creator, and will not be "professionally" \
maintained, although there will be effort towards keeping the app bug free, and \
stable. This project will also not accept external contributions to it's \
codebase, so please, no pull requests. You may create issues which will be \
addressed in an unknown time basis.

## User Instructions
This section will be filled out upon the project reaching a "finished" state.

## Developer Instructions
Feel free to clone and modify this project as you wish, following the terms of \
the License of course.

### Building
1. Dependencies
First, you will need to install the dependencies. The common dependencies are \
GCC, Make, and Python 3.

For Linux, you will need to install the (debian, may be different on other \
distros) libx11-dev and libx11-doc packages. 

For Windows, you will need the Windows 10/11 SDK.

2. Building
You must first run the `mk_bin_dirs.py` to prepare the directories for the \
binaries. You can use the build.py utility to easily build the app.

If there is any issue, you can try modifiying the `make_win32` or `make_x11` \
files to account for anything specific to your dev environment.

## Known Issues
This project is currently under development and this will not be filled out \
