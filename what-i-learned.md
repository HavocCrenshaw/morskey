- Something like the `design_thoughts.txt` I made is useless. This is because\
  you have to think about it when drafting `architecture.md`, and quite quickly\
  there becomes a disconnect quite quickly from the high-level "what it could\
  work like" and the low-level "how it should work". There needs to be, however,\
  a record of decisions made. A better version of `design_thoughts.txt`, more\
  accurately representing the process of creating the app.

  Of note, this idea seems to be a *very* good idea, called an "architecture\
  design record." The format seems to be, you make a document per decision. How-\
  ever, the industry standard is dense for a solo, small project. So I will be\
  taking my own liberties in how I implement these ADRs.

- Holy cow, Python is excellent for small helper utilities!
